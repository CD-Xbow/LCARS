
I used the code by Said that made custom buttons with the canvas gadget - see here https://www.purebasic.fr/english/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=62198

I removed the GUI bits and took the guts of it and made it into an include - CustomButtons.pbi
See Repository https://github.com/CD-Xbow/LCARS/

Note - I only have used the standard button with rounded corners. There is a lot
of other functionality I have not tried.

This example (TOS-color-round-buttons.pb) uses CustomButtons.pbi to make 7 rounded button similar to the Star Trek LCARS in form & color

The next examples require a font and an image which are in the Repo
The LCARS font is from https://www.opendesktop.org/p/998508
